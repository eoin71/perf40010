\title{Performance Testing of the AdaptiveCells/J Application}
\author{Van Hung Cao \and Eoin Hyland}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
With the advent, and growth in popularity, of JEE applications performance testing and optimisation has become an important part of development cycle. This assignment investigates the performance of the AdaptiveCells/J application, utilising black-box testing. We assess performance and then carry out optimisation on various parts of the application stack. Based on the observed test results we formulate a model that gives results acceptably close to our observations.
